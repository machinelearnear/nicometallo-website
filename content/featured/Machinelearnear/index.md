A YouTube channel and community dedicated to making AI accessible in Spanish for the Latin American tech community. With 15K+ subscribers and 600K+ views, I create content covering everything from LLM fine-tuning to production ML systems.

The goal is simple: help people who look like me or come from similar backgrounds get into AI without fear, while keeping it both accessible and technically rigorous.
